I am working on changes for creating the SQL to update, but I wanted to convert to .Net 5 before I did this.

Watch for a new 'Create Update Scripts' button coming in the coming days hopefully. Or by 2029. I get busy sometimes
and have too many projects.

Enjoy. Please report any bug on Git Hub:

As will all my open source, they come with triple your money back if you are not happy, after a small $1.50 restocking fee.
