# DBCompare
DB Compare is used to compare two instances of a SQL Server database and view a report of any schema differences. DB Compare was originally a sample of DataTier.Net and uses the same class, 
SQLDatabaseConnector.cs to read the database schema.

This project is also now a Nuget package, and you can create a complete Windows Form Application for .Net 5 in minutes, as shown here in this video:
